After going viral for his covers of popular songs on YouTube in 2013, he signed with Quincy Jones's management company and released his debut album, "In My Room," in 2016. Collier has since released the four-volume "Djesse" series of albums, for which he won multiple Grammy Awards.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Jacob Collier was born on August 2, 1994 in London, England. He has two younger sisters. Growing up, he was immersed in music thanks to his mother Suzie, a violinist, conductor, and professor at the Royal Academy of Music. When he was 10, Collier played Tiny Tim in the 2004 television adaptation of "A Christmas Carol: The Musical." He also performed in stage productions of "The Magic Flute" and "The Turn of the Screw." For his formal education, Collier went to Mill Hill County High School and the Purcell School for Young Musicians. He also briefly studied jazz piano at the Royal Academy.</p><h2 id=youtube><strong>YouTube</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Collier began uploading videos to YouTube in which he performed multi-instrumental renditions of popular songs. Presented in split-screen, the videos showed Collier singing each different harmony of a given arrangement. The videos ended up going viral, with Collier's cover of Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing" attracting particular recognition. Music mogul Quincy Jones was so impressed that he flew Collier to the Montreux Jazz Festival and signed him to his label Qwest.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>After his YouTube success, Collier embarked on a tour of Europe and the United States in 2015. For his live show, he played several instruments in front of a screen showing synced real-time 3D-captured video loops. Using a custom-built vocal harmonizer, Collier was able to sing multi-voice harmonies in real-time. Also in 2015, he recorded an a cappella version of the hymn "Jerusalem" for England's Rugby World Cup campaign commercial.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-363702 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JACOB-COLLIER.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-363702 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=studio-albums><strong>Studio Albums</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Collier released his debut studio album, "In My Room."
