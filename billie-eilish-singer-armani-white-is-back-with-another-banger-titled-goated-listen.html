After listening to “GOATED.” just once, we know that you won’t be able to turn it off — It’s just toooooo good.</p><p>Armani White told us all&nbsp;about the process of creating this hot new track AND its music video, and we know that “GOATED.” will be yet another success for the viral chart-topper.</p><p>“We got this little dance to it,” White shared AND demonstrated on the Jingle Ball red carpet.&nbsp;“We just shot the video with <a href=#><strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong></a> and we’ve having fun with this record the same way we had fun with the last record.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/324254559_1324339494788149_1686537106034512076_n.jpg><p>The “last record” White is referring to is none other than “<a href=#>BILLIE EILISH</a>,” a track that made waves on TikTok AND landed a spot in the <a href=#>Billboard Hot 100</a>, ultimately launching Armani White into stardom.</p><p>When asked if he expected “BILLIE EILISH” to blow up the way it did, White said, “The real answer is yes. The realer answer is I didn’t think it was going to happen that fast.”</p><p>“I had no idea. I couldn’t plan for that, but I was like, I’m gonna work until it blows up,” he continued with a smile.</p><p>“BILLIE EILISH” gained so much traction that it even caught the attention of superstar&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Billie Eilish</strong></a> herself.</p><p>“Yeah, she definitely heard it,” White revealed. “She reposted it, and that’s what helped me get the song cleared in the first place, so that was just a lot of love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages_JingleBall2022-1446387982-scaled.jpg><p>With hit songs like “GOATED.” and “BILLIE EILISH,” Armani White puts on a live show that makes everyone want to get up and dance!&nbsp;It is clear that 2023 will be full of FIRE performances from White, and we hope to catch him on the road, wherever he may be.</p><p>When asked his goals for 2023, he shared, “As long as I can keep raising the bar for myself, then, I mean, I got more work to do, so we got a project coming, we got probably another project right after that. We going back on the, I don’t think I’m ever getting off the road actually. I can’t even say we’re going back on the road. I’m still here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages_JingleBall2022-1448013682.jpg><p>Armani White has traveled all over the world this year putting on unforgettable performances, with some of his most recent ones being a part of the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour.&nbsp;</p><p>White performed outside&nbsp;in the parking lot of the Kia Forum at the&nbsp;Jingle Ball Pre-Show Village, alongside <a href=#><strong>Huddy</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Jax</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>JVKE</strong></a>. When talking about the experience, he said it was SO cold, “but when you get on the stage, obviously you warm up a little bit.”</p><p>“I started like stripping, taking my jacket off, taking my shirt off… but it was a great time,” he shared through his laughter.</p><p>Aside from performing, Armani White was able to “study” performances from stars like <a href=#><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jack Harlow</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Pitbull</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Khalid</strong></a>,&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Bebe Rexha</a>&nbsp;</strong>and more at Jingle Ball.</p><p>“That’s I guess what I go to live shows for. I just study. Like, I don’t even be clapping,” he revealed to us.</p><p>Naturally, Armani White is already an INCREDIBLE performer, but drawing inspiration from some of today’s biggest stars is sure to make him even better.</p><p>Could we even expect an Armani White headlining tour in 2023?
