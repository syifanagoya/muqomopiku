Flair called the partnership the biggest thing he’s ever been part of and is looking forward to the official launch.</p><p>“For me personally, this will be the biggest venture I’ve ever been in. This will be the biggest venture, wrestling, bar none. This opportunity to work with Chad and Mike is the biggest opportunity I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m more excited about that than I have been a lot of things,” Flair said. “To be working with this Ric Flair Drip and with Chad and Mike, it’s the most exciting part of my life right now. That’s just it, it’s the biggest thing I’ve ever done. I can say that for myself personally.”</p><p>Asked if he believed cannabis would have helped him earlier in his career, Flair said he does see the benefits now and noted how grueling his travel schedule was during the prime of his career.&nbsp;Flair said that his schedule was second to none during his heyday, adding that he used medication when needed but never overdid it. Now, he says,&nbsp;cannabis is available as a safe alternative.</p><p>“I can tell you right now that two of the biggest problems, and I’m not just gonna put it in the wrestling business, but in sports, is getting up and getting down. A lot of guys need a lift in the morning, whether it be an energy drink or something, like coffee. But when you run as hard as we do and it’s four o’clock in the morning, [cannabis is] much, much, much safer [than using other medications like Ambien as a sleep aid], especially on the international tours where you’re gonna get off the plane and go to work that night,” Flair explained.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gotta Love That Ric Flair Drip! WOOOOO! <a href=#>@itstyson20</a> <a href=#>@adambwilks</a> <a href=#>@ChadBronstein</a> <a href=#>@Aloumis</a> <a href=#>@MikeTyson</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mH0ZaReIx0</a></p><p>— Ric Flair® (@RicFlairNatrBoy) <a href=#>August 10, 2022</a></p><p>“You don’t get to get off the plane and go to the hotel and lay down for a day to get ready. This isn’t like getting ready for a UFC fight. In our day, we got off the plane, went to the arena, and we didn’t get to bed til four o’clock the next morning. When I was younger, when I was traveling the world as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion — I mean, it’s hard to believe, but I could be in Sydney, Australia, St. Louis, Tokyo, Japan, and back to Atlanta, Georgia in one week,” Flair added, “and wrestling an hour in each town. You didn’t have time. You didn’t know where you were sometimes.”</p><p>Tyson 2.0 Chairman Chad Bronstein spoke about getting Flair involved and explained why he believes authenticity is the key to the partnership succeeding.</p><p class=p1>“Ric’s become an expert fast, and the way he talks about it is very sincere because he wasn’t a big weed smoker. Mike’s a huge weed smoker, but Ric wasn’t,” Bronstein said. “He really started to get educated like I did when I started <a href=# rel=noopener>Fyllo</a>. I wasn’t a big weed smoker when I started Fyllo. And I learned a lot about it and how it works.</p><p class=p1>“The authenticity of Ric and Mike is why multi-state operators are willing to work with them, and then when they come to the dispensary, which we’ve done a lot of tours and Ric’s about to go on one, it’s a lot of fun for the retailer when Ric and Mike show up, and the level of audience that comes. It’s pretty big, so I think that’s what one of the selling points is that a five-year-old knows who they are, and your great-grandfather or grandmother knows who Mike Tyson and Ric Flair are. I think that’s why they resonate, as Ric was saying,” Bronstein noted, “the consistency of who they are, the relevance they continue to create, that’s why operators want to work with them.”</p><p>In addition to Ric Flair Drip, the partnership will also feature Woo Chews edibles and other products.
