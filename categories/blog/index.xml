メンバーの変わった経歴やステータスが話題になりがちです。
サチモスの中でもイケメンのビジュアルリーダーとして人気の、
TAIKING（タイキング）さんも、
実は、かなりのハイスペック男子なのです。
有名なのでは、父親が元サッカー日本代表の、
戸塚哲也さんだってことが知られてます。
TAIKINGの結婚観と彼女にしたいタイプ サチモスは若いイメージがありますが、
ボーカルのヨンスさんを除いては大人メンバーが多いです。
売れる前に結婚してるような方はいないのか、
特にイケメンメンバーであるTAIKINGさんの色恋関係が気になりますね！
インスタにて甥っ子がよく登場するので、
一瞬「彼の子供！？」と焦りますが、
実際は子供はもちろん、結婚もされてません。。笑
どんな女性が好みなのかわかりませんが、
以前に同じ音楽をやってる女性は、
音楽を純粋に楽しめなくなりそうだとして、
同業者は嫌だと語っていました。
きっと結婚相手だけでなくて、
自分の彼女にも、変に耳の肥えた方は嫌なのかなと。
サチモスの王子的な存在なので、
やっぱり、それなりの美女とお付き合いして欲しいですね！
TAIKING(ｻﾁﾓｽ)の父は元日本代表 TAIKINGさんの本名は「戸塚泰貴（とつかたいき）」です。
父の戸塚哲也さんはヴェルディやレイソルで活躍し、
８０年代の日本代表で活躍されたスター選手です。
Jリーグが発足する前の時代の日本代表なので、
カズさん世代らよりも前でマイナーに見られがちですが、
今の日本のサッカーリーグや有名校の指導者などは、
大概は、この８０年代に活躍された方です。
TAIKINGさんの父の哲也さんも、
サッカー指導者としても一流の経歴を誇り、
これまでにプロサッカーチームの監督を何度も務めています。
今年のワールドカップのテーマに、
TAIKINGさんが所属するサチモスが選ばれたのも、
何かの縁のように感じますね！
また、一時期は川崎で焼肉屋を経営されるなど、
その積極的でアクティブな経歴が素敵ですね！
息子のTAIKINGさんも好奇心旺盛な人生を歩み成功されて、親子揃ってかっこいいですね！
TAIKINGの出身中学や高校は？ TAIKINGさんは横浜出身ですが、出身の学校も横浜です。
中学はわかりませんが、
小学校は横浜市立 桜岡小学校出身だそうです。
音楽の専門学校に行ったということで、
父と同じサッカーの道に行かなかったそうです。
運動では水泳を４年間習ってた時期があったそうです。
スマートなスタイルをしてるので、
運動神経はかなり良さそうな・・・。
