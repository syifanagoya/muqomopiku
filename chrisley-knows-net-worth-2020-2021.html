Nowadays, to succeed in the film industry, you need to isolate yourself from every other norm that seems to be around. You will need a unique approach to making a movie or series iconic or to stand out. Sometimes, finding that unique edge seems to pose a challenge for many, but sometimes, it just brings itself to you.</p><p>We have seen actors and actresses choosing their preferred field because of their skillset or ease of doing so. We have also seen producers who have thought outside the box to develop a unique result that will capture the attention of the viewers.</p><p>For these very reasons, we have seen many kinds of shows, movies, and series that have elevated the careers of so many people. A perfect example that could be given is the series that has attracted the attention of many viewers on the USA Network, and the Chrisley Knows Best show.</p><p>The show is all about the lives of business guru Todd Chrisley and his family. Todd Chrisley is a successful real estate developer and entrepreneur. He and his family live in a lavish mansion in a gated neighborhood north of Atlanta. Despite all this wealth, a lot of drama goes on in this family that will attract the viewers’ attention.</p><p>The show has had a successful run of seven seasons, and an eighth season is expected to premiere in 2020. The drama that goes on in this household is not worth missing out as Todd tries to bring up his children the right way. Although his children always end up doing the opposite of what he says, he still tries his best to make things do not get out of hand.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>The first season of Chrisley Knows Best aired on the 11th of March in 2014. The executive producers of the show were Adam Greener, Jim Sayer, and Stephanie Chambers. The series has been on for eight seasons and has been aired on the USA Network. The first season of the series was quite successful, with interesting events going on in the Chrisley family.</p><p>The show mainly features Todd, the father in the household, trying to bring up his children well despite being born in a wealthy set-up and a handful of distractions along the way. Todd had put up strict rules for his children to follow, but they always end up doing the wrong things behind his back.</p><p>The first season averaged about 1.16 million viewers, which was quite a success for the show. Because of the first season’s success, USA Network demanded 12 seasons for the next season. The producers did not fail to meet the demand of the Network, and they delivered a successful second season with 12 episodes, which had an average viewing of about 1.49 million.</p><p>Just as the Network demanded after the first season, they also wanted another 12 seasons for the third season, which they delivered with no big challenge. On the 5th of February in 2015, the episode order was increased to 18 episodes, which led to the season having 18 episodes in total.</p><p>The show went on with no major problems. The show had a successful fourth season and was also called out to make a fifth season. The audience that tuned in to the show had not gotten enough of the drama that went on in that house. The show was renewed for a seventh season and was given the green light to produce a spinoff series.</p><p>The spinoff series was called Growing Up Chrisley, which premiered on the 2nd of April in 2019. The show went on for 16 episodes and mainly featured Chase and Savannah as they embarked on a road trip from Nashville to Los Angeles to prove their independence.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The Chrisley Knows Best show has been a success over the course of the seven seasons through which it has been running. The show was quite a success that it was named USA Network’s youngest skewing original series. There is no doubt that an eighth season that is highly anticipated will premiere with a lot of viewers.</p><p>Despite all this success and the good word about the Chrisleys, they did face quite a setback. This was when Todd and Julie Chrisley were indicted on multiple counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. They turned themselves in on August 14 and were released on a $100,000 bond.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Chrisley Knows Best has been a successful show that has attracted the attention of many viewers. Just like any other successful show, they have earned and won a number of awards on their own. One example of an award won by the show is the Critics Choice Television Awards in 2016 for Best Unstructured Reality Show.</p><h2>Net Worth of Chrisley Knows in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chrisley-Knows-Net-Worth.jpg><p>The fortune of the Chrisleys family is mainly from the efforts of Todd Chrisley.
