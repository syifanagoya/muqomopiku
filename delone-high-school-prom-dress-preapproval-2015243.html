The note continued, "Gentlemen must be in formal attire: tuxedo or complete suit coat, dress pants (no shorts), dress shirt, and tie."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Problem is, many of the students had already found and purchased their prom attire. Which is what inspired parents, who believe that the guidelines should have been shared much farther in advance, to kick-start a petition.</p><p>"We as the paying customers of Delone Catholic have been notified about antiquated and unreasonable restrictions imposed on the formal wear for the May 2015 prom," states the parental petition, which was posted to <a href=#>Change.org</a>. "Restrictions have been posted six weeks before the prom. Many parents have purchased non-refundable prom gowns… Our children will not undergo scrutiny of prom gowns based on outdated, unrealistic expectations and rules implemented at such short notice."</p><p>So far, the petition has more than 250 signatures—but Delone hasn't budged. In response, the administration released another message on March 19, via <a href=#>Facebook</a>, stating that they only had the students in mind. "The early release of the guidelines…was a proactive approach to prevent student's embarrassment and disappointment of being denied entrance to prom due to dress code infractions," the note read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGadnZyku6Z5x6KeoWWjmLWwu8tmp6unnWKxs7HSrGSpqpWWvbG%2Bzq%2BYpWViZX52fpNs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
