That was the question obsessive Beyonce “stan” <strong>Allie Davis</strong> (<a href=#>@Fergyonce</a>) was trying to answer on Monday, April 6, when she quizzed her boyfriend on the most important questions in life: detailed <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong> trivia.&nbsp;</p><p>“I gave my boyfriend a Beyoncé exam to make sure we can stay together. He passed,” she tweeted along with pictures of the questions and his answers.&nbsp;</p><p>I gave my boyfriend a Beyoncé exam to make sure we can stay together. He passed. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Lqv3VEKWFx</a></p><p>— Yoncé (@Fergyonce) <a href=#>April 6, 2015</a></p><p>Like most tests, the questions were split up into different part-itions, and the future <strong><a href=#>Jay Z</a></strong> to Davis’ Beyonce had to score a 60 percent or higher to stay in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>It started off simple, asking the beau to name three Beyonce songs, and got more detailed when one question asked, “Briefly explain the <strong><a href=#>Solange Knowles</a></strong> elevator incident. Who was involved? What was the public’s reaction? Did Beyonce respond to the incident?”</p><p>???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zgl1YbwSDe</a></p><p>— Yoncé (@Fergyonce) <a href=#>April 7, 2015</a></p><p>Davis’ boyfriend wrote, “a billion dollars and Jay Z got punched.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Beyhive member peppered in some questions about her other favorite artists including One Direction, Jay Z, and <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a></strong>. But the majority of the points were reserved for Queen Bey. Luckily Davis’ man scored an 80 percent, proving their futures will be filled with drinking watermelon and riding surfboards.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after she posted the test, it started getting picked up all over the Internet. Davis noted that some readers even got aggressive.</p><p>“I swear some of y'all need to find your chill and maybe a sense of humor…sending death threats over a Beyoncé joke? Pls,” she tweeted.&nbsp;</p><p>Before and after OTR. Truly a mess. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Dusdk6CRPF</a></p><p>— Yoncé (@Fergyonce) <a href=#>August 6, 2014</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Some critics bashed her for leaving her relationship up to chance, but Davis replied, “The Beyoncé test literally took 5 minutes to write and I did it because I was bored and I like to mess with my boyfriend… PSA from my boyfriend: ‘I knew this was a joke from the beginning, and sometimes we love to pester each other.’”&nbsp;</p><p>After the news went viral, Davis posted a “create your own” <a href=#>Beyonce exam</a> on her blog, and later made a <a href=#>detailed mock resume</a>, writing, “Beyoncé, here is my resume, I am applying for Beygency President.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Would you give this quiz to your man?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmesZ%2BjsKZ5xZqlZqWRoLK0ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnTq6CvoZFivra12WapnqSRqbawutKhoKllopq%2BtrXRnqSepqRif3F9lHFr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
