The Truth Behind the Rumors</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Roblox is one of the most popular online gaming platforms in the world, with over 200 million monthly active users and billions of hours of playtime The game allows players to create and explore virtual worlds, as well as interact with other players and developers. But who is the creator of Roblox, and is he still alive?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Creator of Roblox: David Baszucki</h2><p>The creator of Roblox is David Baszucki, a Canadian-born American entrepreneur, engineer, and software developer. He is also known by his Roblox username builderman, or david.baszucki</p><p>Baszucki was born on January 20, 1963, in Canada, and grew up in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He studied engineering and computer science at Stanford University, and graduated in 1985</p><p>In the late 1980s, Baszucki, together with his brother Greg Baszucki, founded the company Knowledge Revolution and developed and distributed a simulation called “Interactive Physics”, which was designed as an educational supplement that would allow the creation of 2D physics experiments</p><p>As a follow-up to Interactive Physics, Knowledge Revolution launched the mechanical design software Working Model in the early 1990s</p><p>In December 1998, Knowledge Revolution was acquired by MSC Software, a simulation software company based in Newport Beach, California, for $20 million. Baszucki was named vice president and general manager of MSC Software from 2000 to 2002, but he left to establish Baszucki & Associates, an angel investment firm. Baszucki led Baszucki & Associates from 2003 to 2004</p><p>While an investor, he provided seed funding to Friendster, a social networking service</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Birth of Roblox</h2><p>In 2004, Baszucki, along with Erik Cassel – who worked as Baszucki’s VP of Engineering for Interactive Physics – began working on an early prototype of Roblox under the working title DynaBlocks. It was later renamed Roblox, a portmanteau of “robots” and “blocks”, in 2005. The website officially launched in 2006</p><p>In a June 2016 interview with Forbes, Baszucki stated that the idea for Roblox was inspired by the success of his Interactive Physics and Working Model software applications, especially among young students</p><p>Roblox is a platform that allows users to create and play games, as well as socialize and learn from each other. Roblox hosts millions of user-generated games across various genres, such as adventure, role-playing, simulation, horror, and more. Roblox also features a virtual currency called Robux, which can be used to buy items, accessories, and premium features</p><p>Roblox has grown exponentially over the years, becoming one of the most popular and profitable gaming platforms in the world. In 2020, Roblox reported a revenue of $924 million, a 82% increase from 2019. Roblox also filed for an initial public offering in November 2020, with an estimated valuation of $29.5 billion.</p><p>Baszucki owns a roughly 13% stake in the Roblox Corporation, the company that owns Roblox, a stake estimated to be worth roughly $470 million as of 2020</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Death Rumors</h2><p>Despite the success and popularity of Roblox, there have been many rumors and hoaxes about the death of its creator, David Baszucki. Some of these rumors claim that Baszucki died in a plane crash, a car accident, or from cancer. Some also claim that Roblox is shutting down or being hacked as a result of his death.</p><p>However, these rumors are all false. Baszucki is still alive and well, and is still active and involved in the development and management of Roblox. He frequently posts updates and announcements on his Twitter account, @DavidBaszucki, and his Roblox profile, builderman. He also attends various events and conferences related to Roblox, such as the Roblox Developers Conference and the Bloxy Awards.</p><p>According to sitename Memprize, the origin of the death rumors can be traced back to several sources, such as:</p><ul><li>A tweet from a fake account that claimed that Baszucki died on a flight with his wife. The tweet was later deleted and the account was suspended.</li><li>A prank by a developer who contacted another developer and asked him if he got back on the site yet, implying that Roblox was hacked or shut down. The prankster later apologized and clarified that it was a joke.</li><li>A hoax by a user who posted a message on Baszucki’s profile that said he had passed away. The message was later removed and the user was banned.</li><li>A misunderstanding by some users who confused Baszucki with Erik Cassel, the co-founder of Roblox who died from cancer in 2013. Cassel was also a beloved and respected figure in the Roblox community, and many users paid tribute to him in various ways.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Conclusion</h2><p>The creator of Roblox, David Baszucki, is not dead. He is alive and healthy, and is still working hard to make Roblox the best gaming platform for everyone. The rumors and hoaxes about his death are false and baseless, and should not be believed or spread. Roblox is not shutting down or being hacked, and is still growing and thriving. Roblox is a game that celebrates creativity, imagination, and community, and its creator is a visionary who has inspired millions of people around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuwMeeZJyqlZbBsL6MqJ1mqp%2BXubDEjJ2cmpxdqbWmedOrrK2gXZeyqbXNnWStoJViv7a5zquqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
