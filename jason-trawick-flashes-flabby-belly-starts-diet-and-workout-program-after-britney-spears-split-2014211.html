After <a href=#>TMZ</a> posted new photos of <strong>Jason Trawick</strong> eating pizza and “showing off his new gut,” the ex-fiance of <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to thank the website for encouraging him to lose weight.</p><p>“Thanks @tmz I needed this,” he wrote on Jan. 20. “Started my diet/workout program today. C u in a month!” The former agent also shared a screenshot photo of TMZ’s article, and a photo of himself lifting up his shirt and showing off his bare belly.</p><p>Trawick and Spears, 32, called off their engagement last January. During their relationship, Trawick lost an incredible amount of weight and showed off his lean, muscular bod. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> exclusively reported in April 2011 that he shed 50 pounds since he began dating Spears in 2009. The “Till the World Ends” singer told <strong><a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> </strong>at the time that she and Trawick “love to work out” and go on walks together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Spears’ <a href=#>ex-husband <strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>, who is the father of their sons Sean, 8, and Jayden, 7, blamed his headline-making weight gain in 2006 on their messy split.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Everybody knows what happened with me and Brit. I’m not going to say that’s the total cause of it but, I mean, just not being happy with myself was probably the main part of my depression,” he <a href=#>told Access Hollywood</a> in 2010. “Once you get depressed, you don’t really feel like doing anything. You’re kind of discouraged about yourself and then the weight gain too, or that makes me more depressed . . . I mean, it’s a combination of all of those things.”</p><p>Since Trawick’s romance with Spears ended, sources exclusively told Us in November 2013 that he was <a href=#>dating Hunger Games actress <strong>Leven Rambin</strong></a>. Spears, meanwhile, has been dating Virginia native <strong>David Lucado</strong> for about eight months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKGaq5%2BjerW%2BwLCgnKNdm7miv8eeqmaenJavo8WMm5ylpKliwLWt0a2qZpyZmsFurc2dZLCnoqC8tsCMqamon6KWum6txa2cq2WSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnSqaOirF1nfXKAkWpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
