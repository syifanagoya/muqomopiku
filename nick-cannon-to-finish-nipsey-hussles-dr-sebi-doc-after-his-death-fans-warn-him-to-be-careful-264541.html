That being said, fans are understandably worried that getting involved in the project might put him in some real danger.</p><p>As you know, Hussle was shot dead at the age of just 33 but before his life was cut short, he was working on a documentary about Dr. Sebi’s trial.</p><p>The pathologist and biochemist is famous for claiming he could cure AIDS.</p><p>Cannon took to social media to share pics of the man and wrote: ‘Where you left off, we gonna carry one! It’s a MARATHON, so I’m picking up the baton! Because they can’t kill us all!’</p><p>In the caption, he was referring to the fact that there is a conspiracy theory that says Dr. Sebi’s death from, supposedly, pneumonia was in fact caused by the medical establishment.</p><p>As a result, it makes a lot of sense&nbsp;that people are now worried about Nick Cannon’s safety.</p><p>He might really be putting himself in harm’s way in the aftermath of Hussle’s passing.</p><p>Here are a few of the worried fans’ reactions to Cannon’s announcement: ‘Protect nick cannon at all cost he gone finish the documentary 🙏🏾.’ / ‘Nick Cannon is talking about completing what Nipsey started.
