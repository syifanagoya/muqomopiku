He is extremely sorry and disappointed not to be able to perform tonight, and sincerely apologises for inconveniences caused the audience and all those who are involved in the event."</p><p id=eNKQj-yWnPl data-wc=14><strong>READ: <span>Gavin Rossdale, will.i.am, other The Voice judges look unrecognisable in these flashback pictures</span></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ecFbguf8VItW data-wc=129>Tom himself posted a personal message shortly after apologising for the situation, writing: "It's the worst feeling having to let down everyone who was coming as well as everyone who is involved in the event. I know many of you travel considerable distances and make plans with friends and family that take a lot of effort, and it is so disappointing when things don't go right... A sincere thank you for your support and understanding." His fans sent messages of support, with one writing: "Just get yourself right Sir Tom lots of love," while another added: "Awww it's definitely not your fault, if anyone is upset at you for it then they are not true fans, people who don't truly care. Iâ€™m sure people will understand, get well soon."</p><p id=e4liVHAbjokB data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Tom Jones reveals what makes him feel guilty</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
