In her 2023 memoir, <a href=#>Tell Me Everything</a>, Kelly recalled her relationship with her <a href=#>on-screen love interest</a> as “toxic” as it <a href=#>affected her bond</a> with the rest of the cast — which also included <a href=#><strong>Kyle Chandler</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Connie Britton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Aimee Teegarden</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Zach Gilford</strong></a> and more.</p><p>“Life became very difficult both on and off set whenever we broke up. We were young and had very few tools to handle our emotions and personal grievances,” the Roommate star penned. “On the days we had to work together and were broken up, he didn’t want to be in the hair and makeup trailer at the same time I was. We couldn’t ride in the van together from base camp to set for the same reason. On those days, the tension on set was high and everyone felt the awkwardness.”</p><p>Following her split from Kitsch, Kelly began to date <a href=#><strong>Derek Jeter</strong></a> in 2008 and they dated for three years. The pair <a href=#>called it quits</a> in 2011 and the former <a href=#>Yankees player</a> moved on with his now-wife <a href=#><strong>Hannah Jeter</strong></a>. The <a href=#>Euphoria</a> actress had a brief romance with <a href=#><strong>Wilmer Valderrama</strong></a> in 2012. Kelly and the <a href=#>That ‘70s Show</a> alum <a href=#>rekindled their romance</a> in 2016 before <a href=#>calling it quits for good</a> that same year.</p><p>As Kelly continued to play the field over the years, she began to make headlines in 2020 for <a href=#>her romance</a> with <a href=#><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></a>. A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that the 500 Days of Summer star began dating the former <a href=#>Daily Show</a> host “for a while” even before the quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic began. After a <a href=#>brief split</a> in May 2021, they <a href=#>rekindled their relationship</a> the following month.</p><p>“Minka and Trevor have been on-and-off,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “Now they’re back together. They realized they’re both happier being together than apart.”</p><p>One year later, Kelly and the comedian <a href=#>called it quits for good</a> after two years of dating. In May 2022, an insider noted to Us that there was “no ill-will” between the duo as their split was amicable.</p><p>Six months after her split with Noah, the Titans actress was <a href=#>spotted on a date</a> with Imagine Dragons frontman <a href=#><strong>Dan Reynolds</strong></a> after he recently split from his wife <a href=#><strong>Aja Volkman</strong></a> following a decade of marriage. Following their November 2022 outing, a source exclusively told Us that the pair were <a href=#>enjoying each other’s company</a>.</p><p>“These are obviously early days for Minka and Dan but it’s going great and they’re both incredibly happy,” the insider said at the time. “Being back on the singles’ scene after long relationships has been a challenging adjustment for each of them, so they’re taking their time and easing into it as opposed to running before they can walk, so to speak. But so far, so good, and they’re having fun, getting along great.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since Kelly and the “Radioactive” songwriter were linked, they have managed to keep their romance low-key.</p><p>Keep scrolling to relive Kelly’s past romances:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq6yppkpJ2coca0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZaWurDB0mapqKWRo7Cmv4yorZ6qXam1pnnYnpirq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
