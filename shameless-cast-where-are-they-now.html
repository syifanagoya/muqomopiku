The long-running dramedy Shameless <a href=#>wrapped up its 10-year run in April 2021</a>, but the Gallagher family’s antics will always live on in viewers’ hearts.</p><p>Based on a British TV show of the same name, Shameless premiered on Showtime in January 2011. <a href=#><strong>William H. Macy</strong></a> anchored the cast as Frank Gallagher, the family patriarch. As Frank struggled with alcohol and drug addictions, he relied on his six children to financially support him and their siblings.</p><p>“The Gallaghers live right on the edge of the law, and they have to skirt the law a lot to make it,” the Emmy winner told Vanity Fair in August 2018. “They’re one paycheck away from homelessness. And it’s a really interesting family to follow, to see what that’s really like. And we make light of it, and it’s sanitized a little bit, but the writers have been really good at, every once in a while, reminding you — this is serious s—t.”</p><p>The series, set in Chicago, racked up 15 Emmy nominations during its 11 seasons, winning four. Macy never won any of his six nods for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, but he did take home three Screen Actors Guild Awards for his performance, winning in 2015, 2017 and 2018.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Emmy Rossum</strong></a>, arguably the show’s other biggest star, made headlines in August 2018 when <a href=#>she announced that she was leaving the series</a> after season 9. “I know you will continue on without me, for now,” she wrote in a Facebook statement at the time. “There is much more Gallagher story to be told. I will always be rooting for my family. Try not to think of me as gone, just think of me as moving down the block.”</p><p>After the series finale aired in April 2021, however, her former costar <a href=#><strong>Emma Kenney</strong></a> said “the set became more of a positive place” following Rossum’s departure.</p><p>“I remember pre her leaving, I’d go to set some days and I’d be very anxious having a scene with her because if she had a bad day, she made it a bad day for everybody,” <a href=#>the Conners alum said during an October 2021 episode</a> of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite any past tension, <a href=#>Kenney added that she still has “a lot of love”</a> for the Phantom of the Opera star. “I hope she finds her happiness,” she added.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see what the Shameless cast is doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BotaK5xKWcrKtdmK60wIywn56qlWKus7GMrZ%2BesV2jvLh7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
