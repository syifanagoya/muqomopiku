Like, we bought a house serious? The Mirror seems to think so. According to the excerpt below, Tom bought a three-million-pound home to share with girlfriend Zendaya in West London. OMG! The house is a six-bedroom property in Richmond, which is a popular neighborhood with celebrities. Sir David Attenborough and Sir Mick Jagger live there. Angelina Jolie has a place there as well, so Zendaya will have another American to light firecrackers with on the 4th of July. But the house isn’t move-in ready for the lovebirds. They are planning a massive renovation first.</p><p>Spider-man hero Tom Holland is swinging his way back to the UK to live in a £3million home with superstar girlfriend Zendaya.</p><p>Hollywood’s golden couple are making Britain their home and have got the keys to a six-bed London semi-near a raft of celebrities.</p><p>The 25-year-olds – who met on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016 – have big renovation plans.</p><p>Their house will include a gym, cinema and a man cave… or perhaps Spider-Man cave, in Tom’s case.</p><p>He already owns a three-bed flat in the capital, while Zendaya – star of hit TV series Euphoria – has a £3million home in Los Angeles.</p><p>A source said: “They are over the moon about the property and getting their first home together.</p><p>“They are very much in love and wanted their first home to be in London where Tom grew up. Everyone is thrilled for them.”</p><p>Renovation firm KGF Group will lead the rumoured £250,000 do-up.</p><p>The source continued: “Tom has made it clear he wants hi-tech security all around the premises, starting with an 8ft steel security gate on the drive. He was also very specific about his man cave and the cinema room.</p><p>[From <a href=#>The Mirror</a> via <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a>]</p><p>The fact that Buzzfeed weighed in on this gives me hope that it’s true. The article makes a reach of Zendaya’s “British roots” because her mom has Scottish ancestry. So it’s not exactly like the prodigal daughter is coming home. However, her great-grandfather was a war hero in Dundee so maybe that’s how Britain sees it. It feels like they just want to take Zendaya from us. You can’t have her! Anyway, the article went into more detail like how Tom and Zendaya flew from LA to pick up their keys and they kept emphasizing they are planning to move in this summer. First lesson in renovation, kids – double both the price and time estimates. Maybe that doesn’t apply to celebrities. I mention the details because I want this to be true. I think Tom and Zendaya have been letting us know they are more serious than we’ve guessed. They both grew up in the business. They had the colossal weight of the Spider-man fandom thrust upon them, they have a lot of shared experiences. Plus, when a couple gets back together, which is my theory about how their relationship tracks, they are usually ready to get more serious.</p><p>I’m less convinced about Tom insisting on a man cave, though. I know he’s very close to his brothers and a few friends so maybe he wanted a game room for them to hang out. But I’m having a hard time seeing him building a space that shuts out Zendaya and all feminine energy. That runs counter to what we’ve seen from him. I’m curious what other renovations this home will have. With Tom’s eagerness to <a href=#>start a family</a>, I wonder if he’s eyeing one of those six bedrooms for duckie wallpaper?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/avalon-06465280371-1024x680-1.jpg alt width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BGUS_2279383_015-1-908x1024.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/a925f8b13a4-1024x683.jpg alt width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p></p><a href=#><img width=100 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2ef7c7e4df3-100x150.jpg alt aria-describedby=gallery-1-753032 sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> North America Rights Only – Barcelona, Spain -20220207- Actor Tom Holland, gives statements to the media at the photocall of the film ‘Uncharted’.
