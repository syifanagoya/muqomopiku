It was the ability to tell her own story, in her own words, that began Teigen’s love for country music. The desire to create pushed her to get an audio engineering degree before striking out on her own as a full-time musician. She continued to feed that passion with multiple trips to Nashville and co-writing with several industry veterans, including<strong> Chad Kroeger, Gordie Samson, Jeff Trott, Dylan Guthro, Baker Grissom, Phil Barton, Patricia Conroy, David Thompson and Buddy Owen.</strong></p><p>After putting in the hard work, Gayse started seeing real results. She made waves online after releasing her single “<a href=#>I Don’t Wanna Fall In Love Anymore</a>” in 2021, which has roughly 3 Million TikTok views to date. She’s even taken home the honor of Trending Track from Stingray Radio while hitting #43 on the Billboard Country Music charts, and amassing over 350,000 streams! An impressive feat for an independent artist, Gayse’s Top 50 single “I Don’t Need A Boy” won Break Out Artist for Acadia Broadcasting and has accumulated over a million streams, with an impressive 39.2 million views on TikTok.</p><p>Keep scrolling to read our full Q&A with Teigen below and let us know if you’re loving “Sleeping With Her” by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sliding into our DMs on Instagram at <a href=#>@celebsecretscountry</a>.</p><p>You can connect with Teigen by giving her a follow on Instagram at <a href=#>@teigsxo</a>.</p><p><strong>Celeb Secrets Country: The music video for your new song “Sleeping With Her” is officially out.
